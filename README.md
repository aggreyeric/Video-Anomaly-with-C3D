`files and what they do.
1. extract_features_c3d.py  ====  C3D network with pretrained weights used in extracting features
2. train_anomaly_c3d_video.ipynb ========    Extract, train, evaluate, and  tsne visualized features 
3. Demo_GUI.py =====-Opencv demo of the working of the model 
`
RUN CODE
```install keras, tensorflow, 0penCV
change the video path in  Demo_GUI.py 
run  Demo_GUI.py```
